## 1.0.0 [The Ez|Ra Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassytown) (2016-03-15)

- removed deprecated features
- made all the management client dependencies `<scope>provided</scope>`,
  so that the user always has to provide a correct version
- removed the uberjar
- upgraded Groovy to 2.4.6

### Migration from 0.x

1. upgrade to 0.9.6; it should be 100% backwards compatible (except of
   correcting some design issues), so that should be seamless
2. if you use the uberjar, move to a proper dependency management scheme
3. make sure you don't use any features that are deprecated
   (use your IDE or the Java compiler to help with that); all the deprecated
   elements have a javadoc with migration instructions
4. make sure you provide management client dependencies yourself,
   because you will no longer get them transitively (see `README.md`);
   once you do that, you can remove the dependency exclusions
   for `jboss-as-controller-client`, `jboss-as-cli` and `wildfly-patching`
5. upgrade to 1.0.0

## 0.9.6 [The Lindblad Ring Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushing_Ice) (2016-02-24)

- if `OnlineOptions.forHost` wasn't called and `OnlineOptions.defaultHost`
  is therefore `null`, operations against addresses `/core-service=...`
  are now performed as-is instead of throwing an exception
- `OfflineOptions.defaultHost` and `.forHost` make no sense because
  an offline client always works with a single file, so they are now
  deprecated and scheduled for removal
- updated `GroovyXmlTransform` to understand new XML elements added in WildFly
- offline commands for security now check the configuration file version
- fixes in commands for security realms

## 0.9.5 [The Heptapod B Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life) (2016-02-17)

- `ManagementVersion` renamed to `ServerVersion`,
  `OnlineManagementClient.serverVersion()` renamed to `version()` and
  `OnlineCommandContext.serverVersion` renamed to `version`;
  the old names are still available, but deprecated and scheduled for removal
  (this is a fix of a critical design flaw that required constant updates
  to the `ManagementVersion` enum to be able to work with new server versions)
- added `OfflineManagementClient.version()` and `OfflineCommandContext.version`
  (server version discovery in offline finally implemented; this now requires
  that all XML files used with `OfflineManegementClient` are AS7/WildFly server
  configuration files, which is technically a breaking change, even though
  it was always the intent and the number of affected users should be low)
- added commands for the security subsystem
- added commands for security realms
- added commands for the transactions subsystem
- added commands for managing deployments
- added `Address.deployment`
- management version 1.8.0 is now recognized

## 0.9.3 [The Dilemma Prison Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quantum_Thief) (2016-01-15)

- added commands for the logging subsystem (see entrypoint class `Logging`)
- added `AddMariaDb[XA]DataSource`
- added `OnlineManagementClient.allowFailures` to avoid exceptions
  when operations are executed from commands and failures are expected
  (e.g. `Operations.exists` or `Operations.removeIfExists`)
- setting a truststore is no longer mandatory in `AddHttpsSecurityRealm`
- the `Add[XA]DataSource` commands now reload the server if required
  when `replaceExisting()` is used
- fixed `Administration.reload` when the server is in `restart-required`
- fixed a failure when `Operations.batch` was passed an empty `Batch`
- added a workaround for WFCORE-1082 to `AddModule`
- `ManagementProtocol.REMOTING` and `HTTP_REMOTE` renamed to `REMOTE`
  and `HTTP_REMOTING`; the old names are still available, but deprecated
  and scheduled for removal
- the test suite now uses latest WildFly 10 pre-release (was blocked
  by wrong patching test)

- added command `AddSocketBinding`

  renamed to `protocol`; the old names are still available, but deprecated
  and scheduled for removal
- intermediate builder methods in the datasource commands now return
  the correct builder type
- improved deprecations (all deprecated elements now have both
  the `@Deprecated` annotation and the `@deprecated` javadoc tag)

- added `ManagementClient.onlineLazy`
- `OnlineManagementClient` implements `Closeable`
